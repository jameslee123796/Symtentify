Symtentify is an application which determines the symptoms based on the picture given to the application and provides related information
such as the possible cause of the symptom and ways to treating it.

Using Custom visions application classifies given photo into a symptom, and delivers relevant statistics and information about the symptom and the possible cause providing the user with some kind of assurance caused by clear knowledge of his/her current state.

Currently the application only displays the related information on to its interface, but for future work, we aim to allow this information to be stored securely (possibly utilizing blockchain technology to create a p-block, a patient block containing information given by the user) and share the information to doctors in different hospitals, with auto-translation service using AI for hospitals in a different nation. s
